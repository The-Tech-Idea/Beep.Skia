# Beep.Ski.Quantitative Skia Controls Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the creation of Skia-based UI controls for the Beep.Ski.Quantitative project, which focuses on quantitative analysis and data visualization. The controls will leverage Beep.Skia as the core rendering framework and Beep.Skia.Model for interfaces and data contracts.

## Project Purpose
Beep.Ski.Quantitative provides quantitative analysis tools, requiring specialized controls for data visualization, charts, graphs, and analytical interfaces.

## Required Skia Controls

### 1. Chart Controls
- **LineChart**: For time series data visualization
- **BarChart**: For categorical data comparison
- **ScatterPlot**: For correlation analysis
- **Histogram**: For distribution analysis

### 2. Data Visualization Controls
- **DataGrid**: Enhanced grid with quantitative features
- **HeatMap**: For matrix data visualization
- **Gauge**: For KPI and metric display
- **TrendIndicator**: For showing data trends

### 3. Analytical Controls
- **Calculator**: For quantitative computations
- **FormulaEditor**: For mathematical expressions
- **StatisticsPanel**: For displaying statistical measures

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (1-2 weeks)
1. Set up project dependencies on Beep.Skia and Beep.Skia.Model
2. Create base QuantitativeControl class inheriting from SkiaComponent
3. Implement data binding interfaces using IConnectionPoint
4. Set up event handling for data updates

### Phase 2: Basic Chart Controls (2-3 weeks)
1. Implement LineChart with absolute coordinate rendering
2. Add BarChart with Material Design styling
3. Create ScatterPlot with interactive points
4. Develop Histogram with configurable bins

### Phase 3: Advanced Visualization (2-3 weeks)
1. Build HeatMap with color gradients
2. Implement Gauge with smooth animations
3. Create TrendIndicator with real-time updates
4. Develop DataGrid with sorting and filtering

### Phase 4: Analytical Tools (1-2 weeks)
1. Implement Calculator control
2. Create FormulaEditor with syntax highlighting
3. Build StatisticsPanel with computed metrics
4. Add export capabilities for charts

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing (1 week)
1. Integrate controls with DrawingManager
2. Implement connection points for data flow
3. Add unit tests for each control
4. Performance optimization

## Dependencies
- Beep.Skia: Core rendering and component framework
- Beep.Skia.Model: Interfaces for connections and data contracts
- SkiaSharp: Graphics rendering
- System.Numerics: For mathematical computations

## Key Patterns
- Use absolute coordinates for all rendering (X, Y, X+Width, Y+Height)
- Implement Material Design 3.0 styling
- Support drag-and-drop for control positioning
- Enable connection tracking for data flow
- Follow PascalCase naming conventions

## Success Criteria
- All controls render correctly with absolute coordinates
- Smooth performance with large datasets
- Proper integration with DrawingManager
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean, maintainable code following project conventions
