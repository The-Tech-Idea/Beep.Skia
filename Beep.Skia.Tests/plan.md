# Beep.Skia.Tests Skia Controls Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the creation of Skia-based test controls and utilities for the Beep.Skia.Tests project, which focuses on testing the Beep.Skia framework components. The controls will leverage Beep.Skia as the core rendering framework and Beep.Skia.Model for interfaces and data contracts.

## Project Purpose
Beep.Skia.Tests provides testing infrastructure for Skia controls, requiring test controls for automated testing, visual verification, and performance benchmarking.

## Required Skia Controls

### 1. Test Utility Controls
- **TestRunner**: For running test suites
- **VisualVerifier**: For visual regression testing
- **PerformanceMonitor**: For performance benchmarking
- **TestReporter**: For test result reporting

### 2. Mock Controls
- **MockComponent**: For testing component interactions
- **MockCanvas**: For testing rendering
- **MockEventSource**: For testing event handling
- **MockDataSource**: For testing data binding

### 3. Debugging Controls
- **DebugOverlay**: For debugging visual issues
- **BoundsVisualizer**: For showing component bounds
- **EventLogger**: For logging component events
- **PerformanceProfiler**: For profiling rendering

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (1 week)
1. Set up project dependencies on Beep.Skia and Beep.Skia.Model
2. Create base TestControl class inheriting from SkiaComponent
3. Implement testing interfaces using IConnectionPoint
4. Set up event handling for test updates

### Phase 2: Test Utility Controls (2 weeks)
1. Implement TestRunner with test execution
2. Add VisualVerifier with image comparison
3. Create PerformanceMonitor with metrics
4. Develop TestReporter with result visualization

### Phase 3: Mock Controls (2 weeks)
1. Build MockComponent with configurable behavior
2. Implement MockCanvas with drawing verification
3. Create MockEventSource with event simulation
4. Develop MockDataSource with test data

### Phase 4: Debugging Tools (1 week)
1. Implement DebugOverlay with diagnostic info
2. Create BoundsVisualizer with bound highlighting
3. Build EventLogger with event tracking
4. Add PerformanceProfiler with timing analysis

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing (1 week)
1. Integrate controls with DrawingManager
2. Implement connection points for test flow
3. Add unit tests for each control
4. Performance optimization

## Dependencies
- Beep.Skia: Core rendering and component framework
- Beep.Skia.Model: Interfaces for connections and data contracts
- SkiaSharp: Graphics rendering
- NUnit or xUnit: For testing framework

## Key Patterns
- Use absolute coordinates for all rendering (X, Y, X+Width, Y+Height)
- Implement Material Design 3.0 styling
- Support drag-and-drop for control positioning
- Enable connection tracking for test flow
- Follow PascalCase naming conventions

## Success Criteria
- All controls render correctly with absolute coordinates
- Comprehensive testing capabilities
- Proper integration with DrawingManager
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean, maintainable code following project conventions
