# Beep.Skia.ETL Skia Controls Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the creation of Skia-based UI controls for the Beep.Skia.ETL project, which focuses on Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process design and data pipeline visualization. The controls will leverage Beep.Skia as the core rendering framework and Beep.Skia.Model for interfaces and data contracts.

## Project Purpose
Beep.Skia.ETL provides ETL pipeline design tools, requiring controls for data flow diagrams, transformation steps, and pipeline monitoring.

## Required Skia Controls

### 1. Data Flow Controls
- **DataSource**: For data input sources
- **DataSink**: For data output destinations
- **Transformer**: For data transformation steps
- **DataFlow**: For connecting data sources

### 2. ETL Pipeline Controls
- **ETLPipeline**: Main pipeline designer
- **ETLStep**: For individual ETL steps
- **DataMapper**: For field mapping
- **Validator**: For data validation rules

### 3. Monitoring Controls
- **PipelineMonitor**: For pipeline status
- **DataQualityGauge**: For data quality metrics
- **PerformanceChart**: For pipeline performance
- **ErrorHandler**: For error handling visualization

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (1-2 weeks)
1. Set up project dependencies on Beep.Skia and Beep.Skia.Model
2. Create base ETLControl class inheriting from SkiaComponent
3. Implement data flow interfaces using IConnectionPoint
4. Set up event handling for pipeline updates

### Phase 2: Basic Data Flow Controls (2-3 weeks)
1. Implement DataSource with connection points
2. Add DataSink with output indicators
3. Create Transformer with processing visualization
4. Develop DataFlow with animated connections

### Phase 3: Advanced ETL Controls (2-3 weeks)
1. Build ETLPipeline designer surface
2. Implement ETLStep with step types
3. Create DataMapper with drag-and-drop mapping
4. Develop Validator with rule visualization

### Phase 4: Monitoring Tools (1-2 weeks)
1. Implement PipelineMonitor control
2. Create DataQualityGauge with metrics
3. Build PerformanceChart for analytics
4. Add ErrorHandler with error flows

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing (1 week)
1. Integrate controls with DrawingManager
2. Implement connection points for data flow
3. Add unit tests for each control
4. Performance optimization

## Dependencies
- Beep.Skia: Core rendering and component framework
- Beep.Skia.Model: Interfaces for connections and data contracts
- SkiaSharp: Graphics rendering
- System.Data: For data operations

## Key Patterns
- Use absolute coordinates for all rendering (X, Y, X+Width, Y+Height)
- Implement Material Design 3.0 styling
- Support drag-and-drop for control positioning
- Enable connection tracking for data flow
- Follow PascalCase naming conventions

## Success Criteria
- All controls render correctly with absolute coordinates
- Smooth ETL pipeline design experience
- Proper integration with DrawingManager
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean, maintainable code following project conventions
