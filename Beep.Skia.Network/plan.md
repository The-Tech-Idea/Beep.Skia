# Beep.Skia.Network Skia Controls Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the creation of Skia-based UI controls for the Beep.Skia.Network project, which focuses on network visualization and analysis. The controls will leverage Beep.Skia as the core rendering framework and Beep.Skia.Model for interfaces and data contracts.

## Project Purpose
Beep.Skia.Network provides network analysis and visualization tools, requiring controls for network graphs, node-link diagrams, and network metrics.

## Required Skia Controls

### 1. Network Graph Controls
- **NetworkNode**: For network nodes/entities
- **NetworkLink**: For connections between nodes
- **NetworkGraph**: Main graph visualization
- **NodeCluster**: For grouping related nodes

### 2. Analysis Controls
- **NetworkAnalyzer**: For network metrics
- **PathFinder**: For shortest path visualization
- **CentralityMeasure**: For node importance
- **CommunityDetector**: For network communities

### 3. Interactive Controls
- **GraphNavigator**: For graph navigation
- **FilterPanel**: For node/link filtering
- **LayoutSelector**: For graph layout algorithms
- **ExportPanel**: For graph export options

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (1-2 weeks)
1. Set up project dependencies on Beep.Skia and Beep.Skia.Model
2. Create base NetworkControl class inheriting from SkiaComponent
3. Implement network interfaces using IConnectionPoint
4. Set up event handling for graph updates

### Phase 2: Basic Graph Controls (2-3 weeks)
1. Implement NetworkNode with customizable shapes
2. Add NetworkLink with curved connections
3. Create NetworkGraph with force-directed layout
4. Develop NodeCluster with grouping visualization

### Phase 3: Advanced Analysis Controls (2-3 weeks)
1. Build NetworkAnalyzer with metrics display
2. Implement PathFinder with path highlighting
3. Create CentralityMeasure with node sizing
4. Develop CommunityDetector with color coding

### Phase 4: Interactive Tools (1-2 weeks)
1. Implement GraphNavigator with zoom/pan
2. Create FilterPanel with dynamic filtering
3. Build LayoutSelector with algorithm options
4. Add ExportPanel with multiple formats

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing (1 week)
1. Integrate controls with DrawingManager
2. Implement connection points for network flow
3. Add unit tests for each control
4. Performance optimization

## Dependencies
- Beep.Skia: Core rendering and component framework
- Beep.Skia.Model: Interfaces for connections and data contracts
- SkiaSharp: Graphics rendering
- System.Collections.Generic: For graph data structures

## Key Patterns
- Use absolute coordinates for all rendering (X, Y, X+Width, Y+Height)
- Implement Material Design 3.0 styling
- Support drag-and-drop for control positioning
- Enable connection tracking for network flow
- Follow PascalCase naming conventions

## Success Criteria
- All controls render correctly with absolute coordinates
- Smooth network visualization experience
- Proper integration with DrawingManager
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean, maintainable code following project conventions
