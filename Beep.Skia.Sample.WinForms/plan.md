# Beep.Skia.Sample.WinForms Skia Controls Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the creation of additional Skia-based UI controls for the Beep.Skia.Sample.WinForms project, which serves as a demonstration and testing ground for the Beep.Skia framework. The controls will leverage Beep.Skia as the core rendering framework and Beep.Skia.Model for interfaces and data contracts.

## Project Purpose
Beep.Skia.Sample.WinForms provides sample implementations and demonstrations of Skia controls, requiring a variety of example controls to showcase framework capabilities.

## Required Skia Controls

### 1. Sample UI Controls
- **SampleButton**: Demonstrates button variations
- **SamplePanel**: Shows panel layouts
- **SampleLabel**: Illustrates text rendering
- **SampleInput**: For form input examples

### 2. Interactive Samples
- **SampleMenu**: Menu system demonstration
- **SampleDialog**: Modal dialog examples
- **SampleTooltip**: Tooltip functionality
- **SampleNotification**: Notification system

### 3. Advanced Samples
- **SampleChart**: Chart control examples
- **SampleGrid**: Data grid demonstrations
- **SampleTree**: Tree view controls
- **SampleCanvas**: Custom drawing examples

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (1 week)
1. Set up project dependencies on Beep.Skia and Beep.Skia.Model
2. Create base SampleControl class inheriting from SkiaComponent
3. Implement sample interfaces using IConnectionPoint
4. Set up event handling for sample interactions

### Phase 2: Basic UI Samples (2 weeks)
1. Implement SampleButton with different styles
2. Add SamplePanel with layout examples
3. Create SampleLabel with text variations
4. Develop SampleInput with validation

### Phase 3: Interactive Samples (2 weeks)
1. Build SampleMenu with hierarchical items
2. Implement SampleDialog with modal behavior
3. Create SampleTooltip with positioning
4. Develop SampleNotification with animations

### Phase 4: Advanced Samples (2 weeks)
1. Implement SampleChart with data binding
2. Create SampleGrid with sorting/filtering
3. Build SampleTree with expand/collapse
4. Add SampleCanvas with custom drawing

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing (1 week)
1. Integrate controls with DrawingManager
2. Implement connection points for sample flow
3. Add unit tests for each control
4. Performance optimization

## Dependencies
- Beep.Skia: Core rendering and component framework
- Beep.Skia.Model: Interfaces for connections and data contracts
- SkiaSharp: Graphics rendering
- System.Windows.Forms: For WinForms integration

## Key Patterns
- Use absolute coordinates for all rendering (X, Y, X+Width, Y+Height)
- Implement Material Design 3.0 styling
- Support drag-and-drop for control positioning
- Enable connection tracking for sample flow
- Follow PascalCase naming conventions

## Success Criteria
- All controls render correctly with absolute coordinates
- Comprehensive demonstration of framework capabilities
- Proper integration with DrawingManager
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean, maintainable code following project conventions
